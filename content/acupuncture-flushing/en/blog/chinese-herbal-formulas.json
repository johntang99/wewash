Rather than using a single herb, we combine multiple herbs that work together to balance the body.\n\n## How a Formula Is Built\n\n- We start with a TCM diagnosis (pattern identification).\n- A core formula is selected to address the primary pattern.\n- Supporting herbs are added for secondary symptoms.\n- The formula is adjusted as your condition changes.\n\n## What to Expect\n\nYou will receive clear instructions for preparation and dosage. Many patients notice changes within 1–2 weeks, and we refine the formula as progress continues.\n\n## Safety and Quality\n\nWe source herbs from reputable suppliers and screen for purity. Your formula is tailored to your medical history and current medications."
