You might wake up tired, feel more irritable, or notice that digestion is off even when your routine has not changed much. A reset is not a cleanse. It is a steadying plan that makes energy, sleep, and digestion more predictable as the season shifts.\n\n## Start with your signals\n\nIf you notice two or more of these, a reset can help:\n\n- Morning fatigue but a busy mind at night\n- Bloating, irregular appetite, or reflux\n- Neck or jaw tension that builds quickly\n- Restless sleep or waking between 1–3 a.m.\n- Feeling more reactive than usual\n\nThese are common in early spring and often improve with small, consistent changes.\n\n## Why spring can amplify symptoms\n\nSeasonal change affects circadian rhythm, stress hormones, and immune activity. That can make digestion more sensitive and sleep less stable. In TCM, spring is linked to the Liver system, which supports smooth movement and emotional regulation. When that system feels constrained, people often feel tight, restless, or bloated. The practical goal is to restore circulation and lower stress tone so the body adapts rather than resists.\n\n## What a reset plan looks like in real life\n\nThe most effective plans are simple and repeatable:\n\n**1) Warm meals as the default**  \nChoose cooked meals with vegetables and protein. Many people feel better when they reduce heavy meals late at night.\n\n**2) Daily movement**  \nA 20–30 minute walk or gentle mobility routine supports circulation and digestion.\n\n**3) Consistent sleep timing**  \nGo to bed within the same one‑hour window most nights. Regular timing often matters more than total hours.\n\nIf you want to pair this with care, start with the [acupuncture service page](/en/services#acupuncture).\n\n## How acupuncture helps during seasonal transitions\n\nAcupuncture is often used to calm the stress response and support circulation, which can improve sleep and digestion. It is also used for muscle tension that builds during seasonal transitions. NIH and WHO recognize acupuncture as a therapy used for pain and stress‑related conditions, which aligns with how many patients use it in spring.\n\nFor another seasonal routine that supports the same goals, see the [seasonal allergy support guide](/en/blog/seasonal-allergy-support).\n\n## Who tends to benefit most\n\nA spring reset often helps people who are experiencing:\n\n- Ongoing stress or burnout, including [stress and burnout](/en/conditions#stress)\n- Poor sleep patterns, including [insomnia](/en/conditions#insomnia)\n- Digestive discomfort that worsens with stress, including [IBS and digestive issues](/en/conditions#ibs)\n- Low energy with mental restlessness\n- Sluggish recovery after workouts\n\n## How long it usually takes\n\nIf symptoms are mild, many people notice improvement within 1–3 visits combined with daily changes. For longer‑standing patterns, a reset typically takes several weeks. Consistency matters more than intensity.\n\n## Safety notes\n\nLifestyle changes and acupuncture are generally safe when guided by a licensed practitioner. If you are pregnant, have a chronic medical condition, or take medication, consult your clinician before making major changes. A reset should never involve extreme fasting or aggressive detox methods.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Do I need to change my diet completely?**  \nNo. One or two consistent changes are usually enough to feel a difference.\n\n**How many sessions are typical?**  \nMost people start with a short series over a few weeks, then adjust based on response.\n\n**Can this help if I already exercise regularly?**  \nYes. Many active people use a reset to improve recovery and sleep.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis article is for educational purposes and does not replace medical advice. If you have a serious or persistent condition, consult a qualified healthcare professional.\n\n## Next step\n\nIf spring feels harder on your body than it should, a brief consultation can help you build a simple, realistic reset plan.",
