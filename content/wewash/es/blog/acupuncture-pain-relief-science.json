The short answer is that acupuncture influences how the nervous system, muscles, and circulation respond to pain signals. The longer answer is below, in plain language.\n\n---\n\n## What research suggests is happening\n\nStudies point to several overlapping effects rather than one single mechanism.\n\n### 1) Nervous system modulation\nAcupuncture stimulates sensory nerves that send signals to the spinal cord and brain. This can reduce the intensity of pain signals and change how the brain interprets them.\n\n### 2) Endorphin and neurotransmitter release\nTreatment has been shown to increase natural pain-relieving chemicals such as endorphins. Many patients describe a calm, relaxed feeling during or after treatment, which fits this finding.\n\n### 3) Reduced inflammation\nNeedle stimulation can trigger local circulation changes that help reduce inflammatory markers and improve tissue repair. This is especially relevant for chronic joint or tendon pain.\n\n### 4) Muscle relaxation and trigger point release\nWhen needles target tight areas, they can help muscles release and reset. This improves range of motion and reduces guarding patterns that keep pain stuck.\n\n---\n\n## How this compares to medication\n\nMedications usually target a single pathway. Acupuncture influences multiple systems at once, which is why it can help when one approach is not enough.\n\nCommon effects reported in studies and clinical practice:\n\n- Reduced pain intensity\n- Improved mobility and range of motion\n- Better sleep and reduced stress response\n- Lower reliance on pain medication over time\n\n---\n\n## What conditions respond well\n\nAcupuncture is commonly used for:\n\n- Low back and neck pain\n- Shoulder and knee pain\n- Headaches and migraines\n- Joint stiffness and overuse injuries\n\nIf your pain is tied to stress or sleep disruption, combining treatment with lifestyle changes often improves results. For a general overview of care, see the [acupuncture service page](/en/services#acupuncture).\n\n---\n\n## What a treatment plan looks like\n\nMost people start with a short series of visits to build momentum, then space visits out. The plan is adjusted based on response, not a fixed schedule.\n\nIf pain is long-standing or complicated, the plan may include other supports such as movement, sleep improvement, and stress reduction strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Limits and safety\n\nAcupuncture is safe when performed by a licensed practitioner. It is not a replacement for urgent care. If pain is sudden, severe, or accompanied by weakness, numbness, or fever, medical evaluation is essential.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Is acupuncture just a placebo?**  \nEvidence suggests it produces measurable physiological changes beyond placebo, especially for pain conditions.\n\n**How many sessions do most people need?**  \nMany notice changes within 3 to 6 visits, but chronic pain often takes longer.\n\n**Can I combine acupuncture with other care?**  \nYes. It is commonly used alongside physical therapy, primary care, and lifestyle changes.\n\n---\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis article is for educational purposes and does not replace medical advice. If you have a serious or persistent condition, consult a qualified healthcare professional.\n\n---\n\n## Want a clearer pain plan?\n\nIf you are dealing with ongoing pain and want a structured approach, schedule a consultation to see whether acupuncture fits your care goals."
