    "story": "For the past 5 years, we've been proud to serve the Middletown community with reliable and high-quality laundry care. What began as North Street Laundromat has evolved into WeWash - a fresh brand identity that reflects our commitment to innovation and excellence.\n\nOur journey started with a simple goal: provide a clean, welcoming space where people can do their laundry without stress. Over the years, we've added professional wash & fold service, on-site alterations, and community programs like our Kids Zone and Wash & Fold Club.\n\nWe've partnered with local businesses like Gallery Chang to create the Kids Creative Zone, making laundry day easier for parents. We've hosted charity flea markets, holiday raffles, and community events - giving back to the neighborhood that supports us.\n\nToday, WeWash is more than a laundromat. It's a community hub where neighbors meet, families get things done, and everyone is treated with respect and care. Our machines are modern, our team is friendly, and our commitment to quality never wavers.\n\nThank you for being part of our journey. We can't wait for the next chapter with you.",
