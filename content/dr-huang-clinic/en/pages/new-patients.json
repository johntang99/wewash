        "question": "Will acupuncture hurt?",
        "answer": "Most people feel little to no pain. The needles are hair-thin (much finer than injection needles), and insertion feels like a tiny pinch or mosquito bite, if anything. Once needles are in place, most patients feel deeply relaxed. Many fall asleep during treatment!"
      },
      {
        "question": "How many treatments will I need?",
        "answer": "This varies by condition. Acute issues may improve in 3-6 sessions, while chronic conditions typically require 10-15 treatments or more. We'll create a personalized treatment plan during your first visit and adjust based on your progress."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I bring someone with me?",
        "answer": "Yes! You're welcome to bring a friend or family member. They can wait in our reception area or, with your permission, join you during the consultation portion of your visit. For privacy and optimal relaxation, they typically can't stay during treatment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I'm afraid of needles?",
        "answer": "Many people who are nervous about needles are pleasantly surprised by acupuncture. The needles are extremely thin and insertion is usually painless. We'll go at your pace, explain everything, and can start with fewer needles if you prefer. We also offer non-needle modalities like herbal medicine, cupping, and massage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I continue my medications?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely continue all prescribed medications unless your prescribing doctor tells you otherwise. Acupuncture complements conventional medicine and doesn't require you to stop medications. Never discontinue prescription medications without consulting your doctor."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do after treatment?",
        "answer": "Rest! Avoid strenuous activity for a few hours after treatment. Drink plenty of water. You may feel deeply relaxed, energized, or sleepy—all normal responses. Avoid alcohol for 24 hours after treatment to give your body the best chance to heal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I exercise before my appointment?",
        "answer": "Light exercise is fine, but avoid intense workouts right before treatment as they can affect pulse diagnosis and how your body responds to acupuncture. Save vigorous exercise for the day after treatment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I need to cancel or reschedule?",
        "answer": "Please give us at least 24 hours notice. Late cancellations (less than 24 hours) or no-shows are charged 50% of the treatment fee. We understand emergencies happen and will work with you in those situations."
