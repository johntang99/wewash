    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does acupuncture hurt?",
        "answer": "Most people feel little to no pain during acupuncture. The needles are hair-thin (much finer than injection needles), and insertion typically feels like a tiny pinch or mosquito bite, if anything at all. Once the needles are in place, most patients experience deep relaxation and many fall asleep during treatment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many treatments will I need?",
        "answer": "The number of treatments varies depending on your condition, how long you've had it, and how your body responds. Acute conditions may improve in 3-6 sessions, while chronic issues typically require 10-15 treatments or more. We'll develop a personalized treatment plan and adjust it based on your progress."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Chinese medicine safe?",
        "answer": "Yes, when provided by a qualified, licensed practitioner. We use sterile, single-use needles and follow strict safety protocols. Chinese herbal medicine has been refined over thousands of years, and we only use high-quality, tested herbs from reputable suppliers. Side effects are rare and typically minor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can TCM work alongside Western medicine?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! TCM often complements Western medical treatments very well. Many patients use acupuncture to manage side effects of medications or procedures, support recovery, or address issues that conventional medicine hasn't fully resolved. We encourage open communication with all your healthcare providers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I wear to my appointment?",
        "answer": "Wear loose, comfortable clothing that can easily be rolled up to access your arms, legs, and back. We have gowns available if needed. Avoid wearing perfume or scented products, as some patients may be sensitive."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you accept insurance?",
        "answer": "We accept most major insurance plans that include acupuncture coverage. We can provide you with a superbill (detailed receipt) to submit to your insurance company for potential reimbursement. Please contact us to verify your specific coverage. We also offer affordable self-pay rates and package discounts."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I prepare for my first visit?",
        "answer": "Eat a light meal 1-2 hours before your appointment (don't come on an empty stomach). Avoid alcohol and excessive caffeine on treatment days. Bring a list of any medications or supplements you're taking, and wear comfortable clothing. Come with an open mind and be prepared to discuss your health history in detail."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I'm afraid of needles?",
        "answer": "Many people who are nervous about needles are pleasantly surprised by acupuncture. The needles are extremely thin and insertion is usually painless. We'll go at your pace, explain everything we're doing, and can start with fewer needles if you prefer. We also offer needle-free modalities like herbal medicine, cupping, and Tui Na massage."
